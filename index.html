        On new years day, at my uncle's place, He decided to do some fireworks in his backyard because he has a Half of card lot. We didnâ€™t go too far from the house, and after a few fireworks that he lit he told me to light some so, the first one I lit it tipped over and one came towards me, one went near the tractors, and one went towards the gas tank which was scary
