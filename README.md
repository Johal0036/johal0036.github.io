My GitHub page

1- CONCEPT
The concept was to create a website that is focused on Accesibility. I used the mockup from my UXD course to guide me on the design and the layout.

2- PROCESS
The process was I made a creative brief, then I made a paper low-fidelity prototype. Then I worked on digital low fidelity and high fidelity prototypes of my webportolio.

I have four pages. The first one is the "Homepage", the second one is "Accessibility", the third one is "About", and the last one is "Contact".

3- IMAGES
All of my images are from Pexels, except the profile picture and the picture with my workstation (iPad, the monitor and etc). I used that image for the tech devices because it shows all the different kinds of tech devices that I own, and that I think it's important to adapt the content and the websites to.

4- SPECIALIZED CONTENT
In the future I am going to create a YouTube channel that is focused on accessibility. My plan is to use the webportfolio to promote my channel. The content will be about accessibility - as I said before - and I will make reviews and give tips about tech devices and other technologies and features.
